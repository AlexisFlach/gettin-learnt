## SCRUM

notes from "Scrum - the art of doing twice the work in half the time"

by Jeff Sutherland

#### Chapter one: The way the world works is broken

- Planning is useful. Blindly following plans is stupid 

When detailed plans meets reality they fall apart. Build into your working method the assumption of change, discovery, and new ideas.

- Inspect and adapt

Stop what you are doing once in a while and review what you have done. Is it still what you should be doing? Can you improve it?

- Change or die

Clinging to the old way of doing things, of command and control and rigid predictability, will bring only failure. In the meantime, the
competition that is willing to change will leave you in the dust.

- Fail fast so you can fix early

Work that does not produce real value is madness. Working product in short cycles allows early user feedback and you can immediatly eliminate what is obviously wasteful effort.

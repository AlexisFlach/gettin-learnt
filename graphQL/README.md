#### What is GraphQL?

A query language for your API.

We can say that GrapghQL is comparable to SQL, but used for queuering your api, rather than the database.

There our other ways to call APIs, the most popular being REST, so why GraphQL?

- Ask for what you need, get exactly that
  - The client has full controll of what he wants from the server

With Restful APIs, when you request a resource, you always get all the data for that resource, which can result in "over-fetching".

With GraphQL you can also describe what is possible with a **type system**: you write a schema that fully describes your API.
